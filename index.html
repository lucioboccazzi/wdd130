      <p>Hello! My name is Lucio Boccazzi, I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I love reading books and watching movies!I've started studying to be a programmer since it's
        something I've always been curious about and now I get the chance to learn about it deeply!

      <p>My country is really big into football (soccer), most people will talk about how we won the world cup for hours if you let them. We are also 
      really big meat eaters and we also drink a lot of mate. I'd say most of us are friendly and welcoming.
